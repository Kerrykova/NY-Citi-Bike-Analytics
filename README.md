Assignment Details:

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report. You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods. 

The following are some questions that were used for visualizations:

How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
